During my initial meeting with my advisor, Dr. Fierro, I am eager to gain a comprehensive understanding of the essence of research, particularly in the realm of computer science. I aim to grasp what it truly means to engage in research within this field and delineate the parameters of a research project that befits a graduate student. Dr. Fierro's response encapsulated the notion that “Research, when viewed broadly, involves the act of posing questions and then discovering answers to those questions.” He shared his research experiences as an PHD student. He started with a broad goal at the beginning of the journey, and consistently tackled problem along the way. My foremost aim for the DREAM experience is to gain a firsthand glimpse into the world of research.

During the discussion of defining my project and objectives, we sketched out a visual representation on the whiteboard. The concept appeared straightforward and appealing, yet as we delved into the details, we encountered a plethora of technical hurdles. The essence of research lies in the principle of beginning with modest steps: addressing individual challenges one by one!

My first task is learning how to use pyarrow, an open source library in python to read and write parquet formatted file.
