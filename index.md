## About Me
My name Qina Tan. I am currently pursuing a Master of Science degree in Computer Science (Non-Thesis) at Colorado School of Mines, and planning to graudate by summer 20234. My academic background includes a Bachelor of Science degree in Biology with a specialization in Physiology from San Francisco State University. I developed a keen interest in programming through an introductory C++ course after a few years of work experiences as an ophthamic technican. This newfound passion motivated me to return to school to acquire the necessary skills for a career in software engineering. The master's program has broadened my perspective and exposed me to the fact that computer science encompasses much more than just coding. The fundamental essence of computer science is to address and find solutions to various challenges and issues. I began my journey in the DREAM Program by asking the question, "What defines research?" My advisor's response encapsulated the notion that "Research, when viewed broadly, involves the act of posing questions and then discovering answers to those questions." I am genuinely excited about the opportunity to personally engage in this process through the DREAM Program!

## About My Project

My project involves the optimization of database parameters for a set of queries on a Parquet dataset using a deep reinforcement learning model. The goal is to improve query optimization.
