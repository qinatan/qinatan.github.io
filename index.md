## About Me
I am currently pursuing a Master of Science degree in Computer Science (without a thesis option) at the Colorado School of Mines. My academic background includes a Bachelor of Science degree in Biology with a specialization in Physiology. After working for a few years as an Ophthalmic Technician at a private eye clinic, I developed a keen interest in programming through an introductory C++ course. This newfound passion motivated me to return to academia to acquire the necessary skills for a software engineering career. The master's program has broadened my perspective and exposed me to the fact that computer science encompasses much more than just coding. The fundamental essence of computer science is to address and find solutions to various challenges and issues. I began my journey in the DREAM Program by asking the question, "What defines research?" My advisor's response encapsulated the notion that "Research, when viewed broadly, involves the act of posing questions and then discovering answers to those questions." I am genuinely excited about the opportunity to personally engage in this process through the DREAM Program!

## About My Advisor

Dr. Gabe Fierro is an assistant professor of Computer Science at Colorado School of Mines with a joint appointment at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory. He works at the intersection of databases, systems, information modeling, data science, the built environment aand the Internet of Things. 

His research interests include (1) the design and implementation of high-performance databases, including graph and linked-data databases and timeseries databases; (2) IoT platforms that incorporate edge computing and cloud resources; (3) issues of digitization and data management in the built environment; (4) novel datasets or applications of data that motivate new data management techniques and abstractions.
