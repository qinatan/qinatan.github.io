## About Me
I am currently pursuing a Master of Science degree in Computer Science (without a thesis option) at the Colorado School of Mines. My academic background includes a Bachelor of Science degree in Biology with a specialization in Physiology. After working for a few years as an Ophthalmic Technician at a private eye clinic, I developed a keen interest in programming through an introductory C++ course. This newfound passion motivated me to return to academia to acquire the necessary skills for a software engineering career. The master's program has broadened my perspective and exposed me to the fact that computer science encompasses much more than just coding. The fundamental essence of computer science is to address and find solutions to various challenges and issues. I began my journey in the DREAM Program by asking the question, "What defines research?" My advisor's response encapsulated the notion that "Research, when viewed broadly, involves the act of posing questions and then discovering answers to those questions." I am genuinely excited about the opportunity to personally engage in this process through the DREAM Program!
